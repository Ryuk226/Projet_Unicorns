        "Machine learning allows the user to feed a computer algorithm an immense amount of data and have the computer analyze and make data-driven recommendations and decisions based on only the input data.\n",
        "In most of the situations we want to have a machine learning system to make **predictions**, so we have several categories of machine learning tasks depending on the type of prediction needed: **Classification, Regression, Clustering, Generation**, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Classification** is the task whose goal is the prediction of the label of the class to which the input belongs (e.g., Classification of images in two classes: cats and dogs).\n",
        "**Regression** is the task whose goal is the prediction of numerical value(s) related to the input (e.g., House rent prediction, Estimated time of arrival ).\n",
        "**Generation** is the task whose goal is the creation of something new related to the input (e.g., Text translation, Audio beat generation, Image denoising ). **Clustering** is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a **cluster**) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other **clusters** (e.g., Clients clutering).\n",
        "\n",
        "In machine learning, there are learning paradigms that relate to one aspect of the dataset: **the presence of the label to be predicted**. **Supervised Learning** is the paradigm of learning that is applied when the dataset has the label variables to be predicted, known as ` y variables`. **Unsupervised Learning** is the paradigm of learning that is applied when the dataset has not the label variables to be predicted. **Self-supervised Learning** is the paradigm of learning that is applied when part of the X dataset is considere as the label to be predicted (e.g., the Dataset is made of texts and the model try to predict the next word of each sentence).\n",
